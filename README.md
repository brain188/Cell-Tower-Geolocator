# Cell Geolocation Project

Welcome to the **Cell Geolocation Project**, a web application designed to resolve and visualize geolocation data based on cell tower information.  
This project consists of a **Spring Boot backend** that processes cell tower data (MCC, MNC, LAC, Cell ID) and a **React/Vite frontend** that displays the results on an interactive map using **Leaflet**.

---

## Overview

This project leverages a backend API to fetch geolocation data from services like **OpenCellID** and a frontend interface to display the resolved latitude and longitude on a map.  

Itâ€™s ideal for **developers, researchers, or enthusiasts** working with **cellular network geolocation**.

## Features

- Resolve geolocation from cell tower data (**MCC, MNC, LAC, Cell ID**).
- Interactive map visualization using **Leaflet**.
- Responsive **React/Vite frontend**.
- RESTful API with **Spring Boot backend**.
- Error handling for invalid geolocation data.
- Customizable marker popups displaying location details.
